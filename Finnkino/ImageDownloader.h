// 1: Import PhotoRecord.h so that you can independently set the image property of a PhotoRecord once it is successfully downloaded. If downloading fails, set its failed value to YES.
#import "PhotoRecord.h"

// 2: Declare a delegate so that you can notify the caller once the operation is finished.
